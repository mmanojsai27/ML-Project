This study leverages a dataset containing monthly temperature readings across different locations to build a predictive model. Using Random Forest regression, we aim to forecast encoded categorical outcomes based on monthly temperature features. The project emphasizes preprocessing, model evaluation, and visualization to derive meaningful insights from the data.

The dataset contains monthly temperature data for various locations. Key details:

Columns: Unnamed: 0 (categorical target variable), Jan to Dec (monthly temperatures in degrees Celsius).

Size: 33 rows and 13 columns.

Preprocessing: Non-numeric characters were removed from monthly temperature columns, and the categorical target column was encoded numerically using Label Encoding.

The following steps outline the proposed method:

1.Data Cleaning:
Handle non-numeric values in temperature columns.
Encode categorical target variables numerically.

2.Feature Selection:
Use Jan to Dec as predictor variables.
Unnamed: 0 serves as the target variable.

3.Model Training:
Train a Random Forest Regressor with default parameters.
Split the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing.

4.Evaluation Metrics:
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R-squared (R²)

5.Visualization:
Predictions vs. True Values
Feature Importance (using SHAP)
Error metrics comparison
